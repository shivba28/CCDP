Accurate prediction of the construction duration is imperative to the reliable cash flow analysis during the project planning phase when feasibility analysis is carried out. However, lack of information and frequent changes that occur as a result of a negotiation process between the owner and the designer in defining the project scope make it difficult to compute real-time construction duration. Domestic and foreign models for calculating the construction durations cannot be readily applied to computation of construction duration for general or specific type buildings in India specifically during the project planning phase as there is a limit in its applicability due to numerous restrictions. Moreover, there are no preceding studies suggesting different computational approaches to predict the entire construction duration for buildings with the approximate construction duration concept during the planning phase. Therefore, based on the collected performance data, this study proposes a multiple linear regression model that facilitates reliable prediction of approximate construction duration for buildings in the project planning phase. The model will allow the owner and other stakeholders to predict the real-time construction duration using the basic information on buildings and to assess the construction durations incorporating frequent changes during the project planning phase. 

Additionally, the project introduces the prediction of cost bear by an owner for a civil construction project. As duration and cost go hand in hand, people also need to know how much of a difference there is when the duration of a project changes from one point to another due to various factors that affect the timeline of a civil construction. Therefore, based on the collected data for prediction of duration, and using this as a factor for calculating cost, this project allows owners to be sure of what all they should be investing in and how much they are going to invest for certain construction factors during the project planning phase. This will help them sort out their budget and put their finances at the right place, at the right time.
